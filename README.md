Leetcode Solutions in Ruby

## Purpose

As part of my role as a Senior Software Engineer at CourtCall, I will be working to develop v3 of the CourtCall application. The backend will be written in Ruby (with some on Rails). This presents an issue for me, as I have not worked in ruby since High School. However, part of being a software engineer is learning new langauges, and my upcoming experience in Ruby will be no exception. I am hoping that these leetcode solutions will give me a better grip on the syntax of Ruby and its basic language features.
